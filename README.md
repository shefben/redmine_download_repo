ChatGPT created the base plugin which was then edited to work with redmine 5.2.2

i have only tested it with a local bare git repo which gets updated every time a comit happens on a private git repo.

this allows users who dont have access to the repo, such as testers to get access to the code for testing without being able to edit the original repository
